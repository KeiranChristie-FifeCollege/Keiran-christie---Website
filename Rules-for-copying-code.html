        <p class="Question1">
            So you want to use my code for your own websites or programs. Maybe I just have a really good piece of code that will fit right into your own idea or something along those lines.
        </p>
        <h2>
            You can copy the code you need for this purpose. As long as credit is given to me in a comment above the piece of code being pasted into your site or program. If the code is a seen feature or function of the site/program you are pasting it into, then I request credit be given next to the shown feature/function. I will most likely already sign my name and link to my GitHub into the code, but if this not the case then the previous requests stand. 
        </h2>
        <a href="SrcCodeLibrary.html">If you agree with the terms here, this is the link to my SrcLibrary</a>
        <p>
            I'm currently writing this as a pre-emptive jesture of good will. I'm hoping by the time I have some specialized code up and running it won't be stolen and used under anothers name. Most likely if this happens I will remove my permission to use my code and deal with the case of stolen code as I come to it.
