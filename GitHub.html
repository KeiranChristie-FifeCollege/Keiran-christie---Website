            For those not in the know. GitHub is a interesting utility, with the purpose of uploading and storing source code and compiled code. You can make it public for all to see and make forking requests. A pretty good system for when you want contributers to help you work but you don't want to deal with the hassle of keeping track of every single bit of code being edited. Or for a fee you can make it private. Since this isn't a funded site I will of course be keeping this website free and public. Although I will be turning down any forking requests. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">Click here to find out more about forking for other projects you want to contribute to on github.</a>

        <p class="GitHub-LastNote">
            Last tip. GitHub can be installed and ran from the command line in windows. <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Or you can use the desktop app which I recommend full heartedly.</a> (Much easier to use in my opinion.)
